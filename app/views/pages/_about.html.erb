	<h2>about me</h2>

	<p>My foray into the technology industry was in co-founding a startup called 1-Night. Our initial product was a web-backed card system that allowed our customers to purchase drinks, meals and tickets to events and have them all stored on their own 1-Night debit card. As the daily deals market became increasingly overcrowded we found ourselves shifting focus to the events and ticketing industry. Within a few months we had repositioned ourselves as New Zealand's premier music ticketing agency. Over the following 2 years we used innovation and brand positioning to battle for market share to the point where we were the largest player in the NZ music festival market, transacting over $10 million in the summer of 2011.</p>

	<p>As co-founder and CTO my responsibility was to help design and build the innovative products that came to define our company; from our early beginnings in the Silverstripe php framework and on to our test driven migration into Ruby on Rails.</p>

	<p>I have recently moved to Europe where I am developing new products for Scandinavia's leading legal services company, <a href="http://karnovgroup.com">Karnov Group</a></p>
